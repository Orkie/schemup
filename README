gui element onFocus, onDefocus?

UI element:
  render
  widget
  focus
  defocus

should scenes have timer triggers?
  e.g. when X time is passed, run this function

could have a generic concept of triggers when F(state) returns true, call F'(state)
and provide a stock timer trigger which can be used
e.g. 
(define (timer-trigger ms-from-now)
  (let ((time-to-trigger (+ (SDL:get-ticks) ms-from-now)))
    (lambda (state) (if (> (SDL:get-ticks) time-to-trigger)) #t #f)))

How to determine if it's a once only-trigger or a repeating?
When setting up, have an 'N' times? Store this number along with the trigger. 
After each run, if not 0, subtract 1. If the result of doing so is 0, then remove.
NOTE: the 0 check is only run if the subtraction runs! 0 indicates 
an infinite trigger. 1 is once, 2 is twice etc.

Transition scenes - scenes probably need a focus/unfocus. This could negate the need 
for GUI elements.

Probably want a common function to handle the actual changeover point between two 
scenes: calling focus/unfocus etc. and building the pair to return?

All menu select handlers should take unlimited args - and just look at the first N that they care about (use a let or something to bind them? or maybe I could have a macro to define a function with fixed number of args, but which translates it underneath you?)
